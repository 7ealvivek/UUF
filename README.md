# UUF: Unique URL Phasor

**UUF** (Unique URL Phasor) is a tool designed for bug bounty hunters and security professionals to perform comprehensive reconnaissance on target domains. It automates the gathering of URLs, deduplicates them, and discovers potential parameters using various tools.

## Features

- **URL Gathering**: Uses `gau`, `waybackurls`, and `katana` to collect URLs from different sources.
- **URL Deduplication**: Deduplicates collected URLs to avoid redundant data.
- **Parameter Discovery**: Uses `arjun` to discover potential parameters for further testing.

## Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- [gau](https://github.com/lc/gau)
- [waybackurls](https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls)
- [katana](https://github.com/ledge/katana)
- [arjun](https://github.com/s0md3v/Arjun)
- [urldedupe](https://github.com/nao20010128nao/dedupurl) (Note: `dedupurl` should not be installed)

## Installation

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/7ealvivek/UUF.git
cd UUF
```

## Usage

### Process a Single URL

To run UUF on a single URL, use:

```bash
./UUF.sh -u example.org
```

### Process Domains from a File

To run UUF on a list of domains from a file, use:

```bash
./UUF.sh -l targets.txt
```

### Options

- `-u URL` : Specify a single URL to process.
- `-l FILE` : Specify a file containing a list of domains to process.

## Output

The results are saved in the current directory with filenames specific to the target domain:

- `example_org_final_urls.txt`: Final deduplicated URLs.
- `example_org_arjun_params.txt`: Parameters discovered by `arjun`.

## Example

```bash
./UUF.sh -u example.org
```

This command will generate `example_org_final_urls.txt` and `example_org_arjun_params.txt` in the current directory.
